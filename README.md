- 👋 Hi, I’m @adam3141
- 👀 I’m interested in Robotics, Embedded Systems and Programming in C++
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science and Engineering
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that interests me
- 📫 How to reach me via me email address at adam_three_one_four_one_dot_hamilton_at_gmail_dot_com
  Remove the underscores, replace the numbered words with numbers
  eg. joe_dot_bloggs_one_two_three_four_at_example.com is joe.bloggs1234@example.com
  
I am doing this to prevent web crawling to get email addresses. Anyway, if you do decide to contact me prefix your subject line with [GIT-HUB] so my email filtering can tag it so it doesn't end up getting lost somewhere.
